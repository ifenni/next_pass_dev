    "* Knowing the time of a satellite overpass (OP) at a precise location is crucial to plan and prepare disaster impact studies. \n",
    "The script below can be used to retrieve information about the overpasses of the Landsat 8 & 9 and Sentinel 1 & 2 satellites over a  selected location. For Landsat 8 this occurs every 16 days and for Sentinel 2A / 2B this occurs every 10 days.\n",

    "All what a user needs to provide is the precise location for which he desires to identify the next overpasses. The location can be input as a single point(latitude, longitude), or bounding box (SNEW coordinates) or a location file path (.kml).
